    "Feedback": "The candidate has demonstrated a good understanding and application of various machine learning techniques such as Neural Network, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. The accuracy rates are decent across all projects which indicates a fair level of practical implementation skill. However, it would be beneficial for the candidate to gain more experience with other advanced machine learning algorithms to become a stronger fit for a Machine Learning Engineer role."
